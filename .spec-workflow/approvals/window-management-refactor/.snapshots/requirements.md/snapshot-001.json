  "content": "# Requirements Document\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThe current window management system in the application uses a manual dragging approach with DraggableArea component and custom window manipulation. This creates unnecessary complexity and performance issues. The goal is to refactor the window system to use Electron's native BaseWindow and WebContentsView APIs for better performance, cleaner architecture, and more intuitive window management.\r\n\r\nThe refactor will restructure the application into distinct view areas: a persistent search header and dynamic content areas for settings, plugins, and search results. This will enable seamless switching between different application modes while maintaining proper window lifecycle management.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nThis feature supports the technical foundation goals by:\r\n- Improving application performance through native Electron APIs\r\n- Simplifying the codebase by removing custom window manipulation logic\r\n- Enhancing user experience with smoother window interactions\r\n- Providing better separation of concerns between UI components\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 1\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Electron's native BaseWindow and WebContentsView APIs, so that window management is more performant and maintainable\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create a BaseWindow with embedded WebContentsView components\r\n2. WHEN the user drags the search header THEN the system SHALL use native Electron window dragging instead of custom JavaScript implementation\r\n3. WHEN managing child windows THEN the system SHALL use WebContentsView for in-window content areas\r\n\r\n### Requirement 2\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want the application interface to be divided into clear areas (search header and dynamic content), so that I can easily understand and navigate the interface\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a persistent search header at the top\r\n2. WHEN I interact with different features THEN the system SHALL show appropriate content below the search header\r\n3. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL maintain the search header visibility and functionality\r\n\r\n### Requirement 3\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to access settings through the search interface, so that I can configure the application without losing my search context\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN I click the settings button in the search header THEN the system SHALL display the settings interface below the search bar using WebContentsView\r\n2. WHEN the settings interface is open THEN the system SHALL maintain the search header functionality\r\n3. WHEN I close the settings THEN the system SHALL return to the previous content view\r\n\r\n### Requirement 4\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want plugin interfaces to appear seamlessly below the search bar, so that I can use plugins without disrupting my workflow\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN I execute a plugin THEN the system SHALL display the plugin interface below the search bar using WebContentsView\r\n2. WHEN a plugin is active THEN the system SHALL maintain window following behavior when the main window moves\r\n3. WHEN I close a plugin THEN the system SHALL close only the plugin's WebContentsView while preserving other application state\r\n\r\n### Requirement 5\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want plugins with background support to persist when closed, so that they can continue running in the background\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN a plugin supports background operation THEN the system SHALL NOT terminate the plugin process when the interface is closed\r\n2. WHEN reopening a background plugin THEN the system SHALL reconnect to the existing plugin process\r\n3. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL properly terminate all background plugin processes\r\n\r\n### Requirement 6\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to detach plugin windows to separate browser windows, so that I can work with multiple plugins simultaneously\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN I press Alt+D in a plugin interface THEN the system SHALL detach the plugin to a separate browser window\r\n2. WHEN a plugin is detached THEN the system SHALL create a new window with a control bar and the plugin content\r\n3. WHEN a detached plugin window is closed THEN the system SHALL properly clean up the detached window resources\r\n\r\n### Requirement 7\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized window management class, so that window lifecycle and state management is consistent and maintainable\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN managing windows THEN the system SHALL use a single WindowManager class for all window operations\r\n2. WHEN creating content views THEN the system SHALL ensure uniqueness based on plugin path or content type\r\n3. WHEN switching between content types THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of previous views before creating new ones\r\n\r\n### Requirement 8\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want search results to display directly in the search interface, so that I can quickly access applications and commands\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN I type in the search box THEN the system SHALL display search results below the search header\r\n2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL allow keyboard navigation and selection\r\n3. WHEN I select a search result THEN the system SHALL execute the appropriate action and clear the search\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\r\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Window management logic should be isolated from UI components\r\n- **Modular Design**: Create separate classes for BaseWindow management, WebContentsView handling, and window lifecycle\r\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between window management and application logic\r\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean APIs for window creation, management, and cleanup\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- Window operations should be responsive with < 100ms response times\r\n- Memory usage should not increase when switching between content views\r\n- Plugin loading should not block the main interface\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- Plugin content should be properly sandboxed within WebContentsView\r\n- Detached windows should maintain the same security context as embedded views\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n- Window management should gracefully handle plugin crashes\r\n- Application should recover properly from window management errors\r\n- Resource cleanup should be automatic and comprehensive\r\n\r\n### Usability\r\n- Window transitions should be smooth and visually coherent\r\n- Keyboard shortcuts should work consistently across all window states\r\n- User interface should provide clear visual feedback for window operations\r\n",
